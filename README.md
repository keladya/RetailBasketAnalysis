# Market Basket Analysis for Superstore Sales Data

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for conducting a market basket analysis on a comprehensive sales dataset from a superstore. The project utilizes advanced data mining techniques to uncover patterns in customer purchases, focusing on association rules that can help in strategic decision-making for product placement and promotions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle competition titled "Supstore Dataset 2019-2022". It comprises detailed transaction records over several years, capturing customer purchases across various product categories.

## Objectives
- To analyze shopping patterns and trends over time.
- To identify strong association rules between products using the Apriori algorithm.
- To provide insights into product bundling and promotional strategies.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **MLxtend**: For implementing the Apriori algorithm and generating association rules.

## Setup and Installation
To run the scripts, you will need to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn mlxtend
